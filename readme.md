# Brief introduction to pandas

Despite being chubby little cute animals, **<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">pandas</a>** is also a popular, powerful and easy to use open source library for data analysis/manipulation, built on top of the <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>.

In my blog post <a href="" target="_blank">Brief introduction to pandas</a>, I present and discuss basic features and functionality for this library using the dataset of players statistics on the series of the <a href="https://www.nba.com/playoffs/2021/the-finals/stats" target="_blank">NBA finals 2021</a> right after the Bucks defeated the Suns in game 5 on the road, and marked their third triumph against 2 from the Suns.

This in this repository one will find the source codes from the article.
